# House-rent

Carbon copy of a summer house rent site i saw. Photos are placeholders and they're gonna be replaced by real photos of an apartament.

FUTURE UPDATE: Accordion component for prices on mobile devices

BUGS: 
- On certain devices, like the ones with more squared shape screen, some photos tend to not zoom in the slideshow and instead they just dragged to the left: this is an issue with width/height of the viewport or the slider
